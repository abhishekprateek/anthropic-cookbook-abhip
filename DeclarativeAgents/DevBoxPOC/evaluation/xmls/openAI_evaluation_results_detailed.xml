		<Query>How can you create multiple test cases for an evaluation in the Anthropic Evaluation tool?</Query>
		<CorrectAnswer>To create multiple test cases in the Anthropic Evaluation tool, click the 'Add Test Case' button, fill in values for each variable in your prompt, and repeat the process to create additional test case scenarios.</CorrectAnswer>
		<GeneratedAnswer>
To create multiple test cases in the Anthropic Evaluation tool, follow these steps:

1. **Access the Evaluation Screen**: Navigate to the Evaluation screen in the Anthropic Console where you'll initially see a single row for a test case.

2. **Add Test Cases**: Click the ‘Add Test Case’ button to create additional scenarios. You’ll need to fill in the values for each variable in your prompt.

3. **Dynamic Variables**: Ensure that your prompt contains at least 1-2 dynamic variables formatted with double brace syntax (e.g., {{variable}}). This is essential for creating evaluation test sets.

4. **Review and Update**: If you update the original prompt text, you can re-run the entire evaluation suite to assess how the changes affect performance across all test cases.

By structuring your prompts effectively and using dynamic variables, you can create a diverse set of test cases to thoroughly evaluate model performance in various scenarios.

				<explanation>The Generated Answer is correct based on the Correct Answer. Both answers describe the same essential process for creating multiple test cases in the Anthropic Evaluation tool:

1. Both mention clicking an 'Add Test Case' button to create additional test cases.
2. Both indicate that users need to fill in values for variables in the prompt for each test case.
3. Both imply that this process can be repeated to create multiple test cases.

The Generated Answer provides some additional details about dynamic variables and the evaluation process, but these don't contradict the Correct Answer. They merely offer supplementary information. The core process of creating multiple test cases is accurately represented in both answers.</explanation>
